    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A meat pie is a pie with a filling of meat and often with other savory ingredients. They are found in cuisines worldwide. Meat pies are usually baked, fried, or deep fried to brown them and develop the flavour through the Maillard reaction. Many varieties have a flaky crust due to the incorporation of butter to develop a flaky texture when baking.</p>
    <p>The origins of the meat pie have been traced back to the Neolithic period, around 6000 BC. Versions of what are now known as pies were featured on ancient Egyptian tomb walls, and in ancient Greek and Roman texts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (14.1 ounce ) packages double-crust pie pastry, thawed, divided</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed vegetable beef soup, undiluted</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup, undiluted</li>
        <li>3 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>4 carrots, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C.) Press a pie pastry into the bottom of each of two 9-inch pie plates.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook beef and onion until meat is no longer pink, 7 to 9 minutes. Remove from the heat and drain off excess fat. Stir in both condensed soups, then add potatoes and carrots. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Divide filling between the bottom pie crusts. Cover each pie with a remaining pastry and seal the edges. Cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 45 to 50 minutes. Let stand on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
